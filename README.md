## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to explore how the rating data from a component like this is collected and stored on the server side.

### Useful resources

Overall, this project was well within the scope of my JS knowledge, so I didn't have to do too much research on the side. Using a static node list was a big part of my solution, however, so I believe this could be a helpful resource for anyone else trying to complete this challenge.

- [Node Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) - The MDN explains the difference between live and static node lists and some example use cases.
